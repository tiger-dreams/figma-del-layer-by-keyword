# Delete Layers by Keyword

This Figma plugin allows you to quickly find and delete layers based on a specific keyword in their names. It's designed to help you clean up your design files by removing multiple layers at once.

## Features

- **Keyword Search**: Finds all layers containing a specific keyword.
- **Whole Word Matching**: Deletes layers only when the keyword appears as a whole word or is followed by numbers or non-alphabetic characters. For example, searching for "Star" will match "Star 1" and "Icon-Star", but not "Start".
- **Bulk Deletion**: Deletes all matched layers with a single click.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple UI to enter the keyword and start the deletion process.

## How to Use

1.  Run the plugin.
2.  Enter the keyword you want to search for in the input field.
3.  Click the "Delete" button.
4.  The plugin will find and delete all layers matching the keyword and notify you of the number of layers deleted.
